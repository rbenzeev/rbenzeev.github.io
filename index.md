## About me

I apply spatial approaches to analyze social systems, focusing on conservation problems that span multiple levels and scales. I aim to understand human dimensions of environmental change and produce politically relevant recommendations for conservation and society. I integrate quantitative spatial datasets and models with qualitative frameworks and interviews to understand, analyze, synthesize, and communicate diverse data sources. 

My dissertation focuses on the Atlantic Forest of Brazil where I 1) tested the spatial relationships between property-level variables and forest restoration, 2) conducted a causal analysis on the relationship between indigenous land tenure and forest conservation, and 3) am evaluating the relationship between multi-level institutional capacity and forest change at the landscape scale.
